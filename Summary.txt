This repo has the flutter codes from the fourth day of my Flutter training, 

[2020-07-22] Day 4{
	Learnt to add Icon,
	Learnt to add Images,
	Learnt to add Scaffold,
	Learnt to add AppBar,
	Session was concentrated on AppBar,
	We can also remove the debug banner from app,
}

[2020-07-23] Day 5{
	Session was concentrated on Body of our application,
	Learnt about Container, Column and the difference b/w them,
	Learnt about decoration property,
	Learnt to style the border of Container,
	Conatainer allows us to use only one child property,
	Column has a list<widget> in which we can write children,
}

[2020-07-24] Day 6{
	Session was concentrated on few core concepts of Flutter,
	Learnt about Hot reloading,
	Hot reloading is the best thing for any developer,
	We need to enable hot reloading when we begin our code from scratch,
	Hot reloading refreshes the update part in the code without completely running the code again,
	This is done with the help of BuildContext and Stateless Widget,
	We will be learning more about it in future,
	Then we learnt about the concept of package (read the text file in day6 directory),
	We imported some packages to change colour of status bar and also to write a toast(toast is nothing but a popup),
	We then used these two packages to write a code and changed the colour of statusbar,
	We also wrote a code for a toast using the imported package.
}

[2020-07-27] Day 7{
	Session was concentrated on creating a custom layout,
	We used te concepts of Container and Column to create one,
	We first understood the concept of margin and padding and how they are different,
	Although we can create a container inside a container but there is no practical use case of it,
	Container can only have one child and there is no use of it,
	We can use a Column inside a Container which can then have multiple children,
	As the name suggests Column arranges the widgets in the form of column,
	We also have a property for Row and also a Stack widget which helps in overlapping of widget,
	Since there are no features of negative margins thus flutter provides us with the feature of Stack,
	Learnt about the InkWell and GestureDetector feature also and how they are different,
	Learnt few more terminologies of flutter including EdgeInsets etc,
}

[2020-07-29] Day 8{
	Session was more focused on the backend,
	We learnt to integrate our mobile app with linux server using http protocol,
	We learnt about the status code of a webapp,
	Learnt about the request method while estabilishing a connection with a webserver,
	Used this concept to execute a python script on our webserver by just pressing a button,
	This was done using http protocol and thus had to install http package and update our pubsec file,
	Learnt the concept of RaisedButton and added an action listener to it,
	The action listener prints the date and time of linux server on our console,
	Learnt about the concept of cgi (common gateway interface) and how we can use cgi-bind directory to execute python script,
	This method is very powerful to execute any command on our linux server through our mobile application,
	While dealing with http package we were also introduced to the async and await keyword.
}

[2020-07-30] Day 9{
	Learnt about few more core concepts of dart programming language,
	Learnt about functional programming and rules to implement functional programming,
	Played with dart functions and understood the concepts of positional arguments and named arguments,
	Also learnt about the methods of string interpolation in dart,
	Learnt about the Function keyword,
	Learnt about lambda expression in dart denoted by ( => ) symbol,
	Lambda is one of the rules to implements functional programming out of several others,
	Learnt about another rule of functional programming that goes by the name, higher order functions,
	Learnt how these concepts can make our flutter code shorter and easy to read while debugging.
}

[2020-07-31] Day 10{
	In this session we learnt about card widget and assets,
	Card provides us with some basic decoration like rounded border and shadow,
	We can also alter the elevation of card but cannot change height or width of card,
	Card takes the size as that of its child,
	We can use card inside a container to change it's size and much more,
	Learnt about the alignment and the default alignments of Column and Row,
	There are two type of alignment, they are mainAxisAlignment and crossAxisAlignment,
	Assets are images or audio or video files that are stored locally in our system and we want to bind them with  our app,
	We can also access our images and audios even without the internet connectivity,
	We need to make changes into our pubspec.yaml file to access assets,
	Learnt to embed audio and image assets in our application.
}

[2020-08-05] Day 11{
	In this session we learnt to take user input through out application,
	This can be done using TextField() Widget in Flutter,
	TextField() widget provide us multiple features,
	We can set our hintText and helperText etc,
	We can also customize widget decoration in TextField too,
	We can customize almost everything in TextField() Widget,
	It has onChanged key which allows us to write an event to perform,
	We took input from user and run that linux command in our linux server,
	This can be done using the technique learnt on day8,
	We created python script in our linux server which we can run through the application and print the output in the console terminal,
}

[2020-08-06] Day 12{
	In this session we learnt to integrate docker with our flutter application,
	Basically we learnt some more concepts about http and cgi-bin,
	We learnt to pass variables in the URL to retrieve some information,
	We used GET method frpm HTTP protocol in this scenario,
	We can pass any variable through URL using '?' symbol,
	Example: http://IP/cgi-bin/script.py?var1=val1&var2=val2,
	We then learnt to retrieve these information within our python script,
	We have to 'import cgi' in our python file and cgi.FieldStorage().getValue('var'),
	This is the basic syntax to retrieve variables that we pass through our URL,
	We basically used this to pass docker commands from our application but doing this is not enough,
	By default our apache webserver do not have permissions to make these changes,
	Thus we made all this a bit more permissive using the basic knowledge of linux,
	*****( I will be attaching the python script in day12 folder and also do refer notes for better understanding)*****
